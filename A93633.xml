            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THere is no Good Proteſtant nor any Body that loves the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> who muſt not <hi>(Great Sir)</hi> extol your Undertaking and bleſs God for your ſo great and ſo unbloody Succeſs; and thoſe that are ſenſible how well you have uſed the power you have had in the World, muſt wiſh that that and your Glory may increaſe: and what follows, is far from deſigning the diminution of either, pardon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, if I ſay it is to confirm you in your own Noble Reſolutions, and to precaution you againſt the ſuggeſtions of ſuch men as may cultivate their own Intereſt with greater regard than your honour. Your honour lies in your keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe to the ſenſe of your firſt Declaration: That Declaration obliges you in the ſenſe of moſt, and I think all honeſt men, <hi>to refuſe the falſe glitierings of a Crown, reſtores us to our Liberties, ſecures the Proteſtant Religion, is good and merciful even to Papiſts, makes you the great Arbiter of</hi> Europe, <hi>gives you opportunity to reſettle its Peace, and call to an accompt that great Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the King of</hi> France, <hi>for the real Invaſions he as made upon it, and to puniſh him for the Inſolencies he has offer'd to your ſelf.</hi> This Management will be ſpeak you great without Ambition, inſpir'd with the <hi>Roman Genius,</hi> which lov'd to <hi>plant Liberty and Good Manners,</hi> more than <hi>Empire.</hi> And tho the King be reſtor'd to the Title, and as much Power as is uſeful and ſafe, yet we ſhall always <hi>bleſs</hi> when you are nam'd, <hi>joyn our Arms unanimouſly with yours,</hi> to make all <hi>France</hi> happy by a <hi>Reſtoration of the Aſſembly of the Eſtates, and to relieve the Proteſtants too, by reviving the Edict of</hi> Nantes, <hi>to pull down the pride of that haughty Man, and approve the Engliſh Nation, under your Banners, the Scourge of Tyrants.</hi> Theſe are the great Things you may chuſe for your ſhare, and I pray God direct you. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>t if inſtead thereof, you purſue other meaſures, and you are either <hi>crowned your ſelf,</hi> or <hi>allow your Princeſs ſo to be,</hi> you muſt dethrone your own Uncle and your Wives Father, hazard our Liberties by ſudden and uncertain Wars, <hi>blemiſh the Proteſtant Religion with the Depoſing Doctrine, unite the Papal Force, ſtrengthen the French King, make your Great Self appear rather ambitious than a Benefactor, create Strong Factions,</hi> ſuch as you can never imagine will be compos'd, till the Reſtoration of the King, if you ſeriouſly reflect upon our Tempers, of which the preſent <hi>Fermentations</hi> give ſome proof. Conſider then, Great Sir, and be great by being good, that the preſent may adore, and after Ages for ever admire You. Let me add one thing more, which is ſeriouſly reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by thoſe that are even trueſt to the Engliſh and the Proteſtant Intereſt, which is, that it is in your power to prevail with the King to give ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Peoples hands, as will make them ſafe; whereas if the King by a high hand returns, he can then act without controul; and the <hi>Infirmities</hi> which we are ſorry to ſee in <hi>Your Health,</hi> makes it even doubtful whether <hi>Nature</hi> has lent you time enough to finiſh ſo great <hi>Enterprizes;</hi> and then God knows what may be the ſad Bargain we ſhall be forced to ſtrike at laſt: Conſider therefore in time.</p>
